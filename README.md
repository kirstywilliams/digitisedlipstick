# Digitised Lipstick

Source code for a new portfolio site I'm currently working on. Will eventually move everything over from my [personal domain](http://www.kirstywilliams.co.uk).

## Todo:

Everything. Work in progress.

## Current State

In development. CI Hook with Heroku, so the [digitisedlipstick domain](http://www.digitisedlipstick.com) will always reflect the state of this master branch.

## Stack

* Ruby 2.0.0
* Rails 4.2.0
* Puma
* PostgreSQL
* Bootstrap 3
* Sass
* Heroku
